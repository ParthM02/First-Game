# First-Game

## Description
This is my first computer game that I have created but it doesn't really have a name so it's just called "First Game".
This app is coded with 100% Java using knowledge that I've accumulated from my classes and other means of learning.
All the code has comments as to why each line of code was written and its purpose.

## Installation
To install, simply download the .jar file.
Run the game by opening the file.

## Usage
Please feel free to try the game out and enjoy yourself with this masterpiece. 

### Once you open the Application
A menu will show up on the screen and the user will have four options on how they want to proceed:
1. They can press "Q" to quit the application.
2. They can press “1” to select option 1 which is a game called "Pictionary".
3. They can press “2” to select option 2 which is a game called "Flappy Bird".
4. Or they can press “3” to select option 3 which is a game called "Mashing battle".

Note: When the application is opened for the first time, it might take 5-15 seconds for the project to load and show the menu so please be patient.

### Pictionary
When the users select Pictionary from the menu, Player 1’s turn will immediately begin so Player 2 should not be peeking. On Player 1’s turn, there will be a prompt in the top left corner which tells the player to draw that prompt. They can draw by moving the cursor using arrow keys and also changing the color of the paint by clicking on numbers 1-4. 1 is yellow, 2 is green, 3 is blue, and 4 is red. If player 1 feels the need to restart their drawing, they may press “5” to clear the screen. Then when the player finishes drawing, the player will need to press “D” to signify to the application that they are done. After that, it becomes Player 2’s turn and can now see the screen. What they will see is Player 1’s drawing and three answer choices that they have to guess what the picture is. They can select their choice by pressing “A”, “B”, or “C”. Once they have selected their answer, the game will tell them if player 2 got it correct or not and will ask them if they want to restart or go back to the main menu. On the main menu, they can select another game or just quit the application entirely.

Note(1): Player 1 may also press “H” for help if the player forgets the key binds to use the application.
Note(2): You cannot restart or quit the game until you are prompted.

### Flappy Bird
This game is selected from the main menu when the player presses “2”. As soon as the game is selected, the pipes start generating and the game begins. Flappy Bird is a pretty universally well known game where the objective is for the player to avoid the pipes and they will be given a score when they finally hit a pipe. To play the game, they have to press the spacebar to make the bird go up by a predetermined value set by the developer. (Me) Any time during the game, the player can quit by pressing “D” or restart by pressing “R”. When quitting, they will be taken back to the menu where they can choose another game or by pressing “Q” to fully quit the application.

### Mashing Battle
This game is selected from the main menu when the player presses “3”. The object is the game is basically for one player to beat another player in a game of essentially mashing their keys. Player 1 is the red guy and mashes “Z” to advance against the blue by a predetermined value, Player 2 is the blue guy and mashes “M” to advance against the red. The first player to advance on the other completely wins. Anytime during the game can the players restart by pressing “R” or leave the game by pressing “D”. When they leave the game, they will be taken back to the main menu where they can select another game or fully quit the application by pressing “Q”.
